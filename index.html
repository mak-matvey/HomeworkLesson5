			<h2 class="biography-heading">Harry Potter's biography</h2>
			<p class="biography">
				Harry James Potter (born 31 July 1980) is a renowned English half-blood
				wizard, famous for being the only known person to have survived the
				Killing Curse. His survival, which resulted in the first defeat of the
				dark wizard Lord Voldemort, marked him as a significant figure in the
				wizarding world, known by the epithet "The Boy Who Lived."
			</p>
			<h3 class="biography-heading">Early Life and Survival</h3>
			<p class="biography">
				Harry was born to James and Lily Potter (née Evans), two prominent
				members of the original Order of the Phoenix. The family was forced into
				hiding after a prophecy was made that a boy born at the end of July
				would have the power to vanquish the Dark Lord, Voldemort. On 31 October
				1981, Voldemort found the Potters' hiding place in Godric's Hollow. He
				murdered James and Lily, but when he turned his wand on the one-year-old
				Harry, the Killing Curse (Avada Kedavra) rebounded. It ripped Voldemort
				from his body and left Harry with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead
				as the only sign of the attack. With his parents gone, Harry was left on
				the doorstep of his only living relatives, the Dursleys—Petunia (Lily's
				Muggle sister), her husband Vernon, and their son Dudley—to be raised in
				the Muggle world. His childhood with the Dursleys in Little Whinging,
				Surrey, was unhappy and neglectful. They treated him as a burden, kept
				him in a cupboard under the stairs, and hid the truth of his magical
				heritage from him.
			</p>
			<h3 class="biography-heading">Discovery and Hogwarts Years</h3>
			<p class="biography">
				On his eleventh birthday, Harry received a letter of acceptance to
				Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, delivered by the half-giant
				Rubeus Hagrid. It was Hagrid who first told Harry the truth about his
				parents, their legacy, and his own fame. At Hogwarts, Harry was sorted
				into Gryffindor house. He quickly formed two of the most important
				relationships of his life: a deep friendship with Ron Weasley and
				Hermione Granger. Together, the trio became known for their bravery and
				for repeatedly thwarting the dark forces that threatened the school.
				Throughout his school years, Harry faced multiple encounters with the
				weakened yet persistent Voldemort:
			</p>
			<ul class="biography-list">
				<li>
					Philosopher's Stone: He prevented Voldemort from stealing the Elixir
					of Life.
				</li>
				<li>
					Chamber of Secrets: He saved Ginny Weasley and destroyed a fragment of
					Voldemort's soul housed in his teenage diary.
				</li>
				<li>
					Prisoner of Azkaban: He learned about his father's old friends and his
					own innocence was proven.
				</li>
				<li>
					Goblet of Fire: He was entered into the Triwizard Tournament and was
					used in a ritual to restore Voldemort to a physical body, witnessing
					the Dark Lord's return firsthand.
				</li>
				<li>
					Order of the Phoenix: He fought the Ministry's denial of Voldemort's
					return, formed Dumbledore's Army, and battled Death Eaters at the
					Department of Mysteries, where he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.
				</li>
				<li>
					Half-Blood Prince: He learned about Voldemort's past and the concept
					of Horcruxes—objects used to store pieces of a soul to achieve
					immortality. The year ended with the death of Headmaster Albus
					Dumbledore.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="biography-heading">The Second Wizarding War and Victory</h3>
			<p class="biography">
				Following Dumbledore's death, Harry, Ron, and Hermione abandoned their
				education to hunt down and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This
				perilous year on the run was marked by extreme hardship, close calls,
				and the loss of many friends and allies, including Ron's brother, Fred
				Weasley, and Hogwarts professor Remus Lupin. The hunt culminated in the
				Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998. During the battle, Harry learned that
				he himself was an unintended Horcrux and that he must die for Voldemort
				to be mortal. He willingly sacrificed himself, but survived once more
				due to his mother's protective magic living in Voldemort's veins. In the
				final confrontation within the Great Hall, Harry defeated and killed
				Lord Voldemort for good, ending the Second Wizarding War.
			</p>
			<h3 class="biography-heading">Later Life and Legacy</h3>
			<p class="biography">
				After the war, Harry became an Auror (a dark wizard catcher) at the
				British Ministry of Magic. He rose to become the Head of the Auror
				Office and played a crucial role in reforming the Ministry and the
				wizarding world. He married Ginny Weasley, a fellow Gryffindor and
				professional Quidditch player. They had three children: James Sirius,
				Albus Severus, and Lily Luna Potter, whom they raised in Godric's
				Hollow. Harry is also the godfather of Teddy Lupin, the son of Remus
				Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. Harry Potter's life story is a testament to
				courage, sacrifice, and the power of love and friendship over evil. He
				is remembered not just as "The Boy Who Lived," but as the man who
				triumphed, bringing lasting peace to the wizarding world.
